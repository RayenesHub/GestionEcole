🏫 School Management - Microservices Training Project
📌 About the Project
School Management is an academic project developed to help students understand microservices architecture by implementing a real-world school management system. The system covers multiple domains like student, teacher, equipment, events, and mailing services, and is designed using Spring Boot, Docker, Kafka, and other modern technologies.

🎯 Main Goal
The primary objective of this project is to provide students with:

✅ A practical understanding of microservices architecture.
✅ Hands-on experience in service decomposition, inter-service communication, and asynchronous messaging with Kafka.
✅ Use of modern tools and frameworks for scalable and maintainable applications.

🧰 Technologies & Concepts
Throughout this training, the project covers:

Spring Boot for microservices development

Spring Cloud Eureka for service discovery

Spring Cloud Gateway as API Gateway

Kafka for asynchronous messaging

MySQL and MongoDB for data persistence

Docker & Docker Compose for containerization

Angular for the frontend

Keycloak for authentication (to be added)

Spring Data JPA and Spring Data MongoDB for data access

🧠 Learning Outcome
By the end of this training, students will be able to:

Design domain-driven microservices

Build a scalable school management platform

Deploy services with Docker and manage with Eureka and Kafka

Understand and implement event-driven communication

🧱 Domain Decomposition
Each microservice is responsible for its own domain:

Microservice	Description
Student Service	Manages students and classes
Teacher Service	Handles teacher and subjects
Equipment Service	Manages school equipment inventory
Event Service	Registers events (meetings, exams)
Mailing Service	Sends emails via Kafka
School Service	Central info about the school
